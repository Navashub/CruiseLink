## ðŸ§ª Testing Requirements

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Registration Flow**: Complete car owner registration
2. **Trip Creation**: Create trip with specific car filters
3. **Eligibility Logic**: Verify only compatible cars can join
4. **Tier Limitations**: Test free tier restrictions
5. **Capacity Management**: Test 30-car limit
6. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile and desktop

### Sample Data Requirements
- 10+ sample users with diverse car brands/models
- 5+ sample trips with different car requirements
- Mix of free and premium users
- Trips at various capacity levels

## ðŸ”§ Development Notes

### Specific Implementation Details
1. **Car Selection Interface**: 
   - Hierarchical dropdowns: Brand â†’ Model â†’ Variant
   - Checkbox system for trip creation: "All Audis" vs specific models
   - Visual indicators for selection scope

2. **Notification Logic**:
   - When trip is created, query users matching eligible cars
